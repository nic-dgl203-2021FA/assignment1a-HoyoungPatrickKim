        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I started my first offical job about a month ago. Before then, I volunteered in several different places to get a grasp of working part time jobs plus adding hours to my resume and meet my graduation requirements.</p>

        <!-- Job 1 -->
        <section class="job-item">
          <div class="job-details">
            <h3>Stocker</h3>
            <p>Garlic & Pepper Eatery</p>
            <p>2021 July - 2021 July</p>
          </div>
          <div class="job-summary">
            <p>Stocking products whenever the products are coming in, plus helped my managers whenever available such as food preparation, taking orders, dishwashing, and so on. There are two reasons why I had a job here. First, I had been looking for a full/part time job after April since my first year was over so I tried to make money and learn some skills. However, it was not as easy as I thought it would be. I had been applying several places, but did not get any calls or messages from them. Therefore, I asked my mom to see if any of her friends looking for someone to work for them. And I got an opportunity at Garlic & Pepper Eatery to work part time! Another reason that I worked there was I needed money for travelling. At that time, I was planned to go on a road trip with friends in mid July, and I did not have much money in my bank account, so I had to make some money to use for travelling. </p>
